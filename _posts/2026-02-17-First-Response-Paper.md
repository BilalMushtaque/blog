# Week 01 Response Post

The first week is usually a relaxing week meant to ease you back into the hectic workload of university. For me it was no different except for the fact that I have taken the maximum allowed credits so it was a bit of a shock to the body to experience these many classes again.

However despite that I had fun. I came back to campus on monday night so I missed the first day of classes, but from the second day we were up and running. We had to make groups for COD 306 which is about the difference between UI and UX. The professor mostly kept the class easy by only explaining the difference between the two.

Next up we had COD 208 which was our second class of coding for the major. It was a nice introduction, where the professor reiterated some of the key learnings from last semester and then went over the new concepts we would be studying in the class.

After that the next day I had IDE 108 which is art and design history. This was a course I withdrew 2 semesters ago because the exams were too tricky for my adhd brain. So I was very glad to learn that the new professor would be having no exams, just assignments and projects.

After that was COD 320 aka 3D modelling, a class I have been looking forward to very much due to my passion of game development. We downloaded Blender, which is an industry grade software for 3D Modelling and the professor walked us through the interface.

The next day we had our studio class COD 301, for which I am writing this blog post. Since this class only had 8 enrolled student, it was a very relaxed atmosphere. We made GitHub accounts and created a repository for the first time, on which we made the blog site on which you are reading this right now.

The last class of the day was COD 420, movements of cinema, taught by a professor I have a very special relationship with, Metin hocam. We chatted for a bit during the break and he gave an overview on how the culture of cinema shifted as eras progressed.

On friday I was unable to attend my class as I slept very late but I learnt that they watched ratatouille in class, which is one of my favorite films.

My weekend was a bit chill, bt=ut I did go on a photo hunt with a friend I made of a different university in istanbul.

That concludes my week. I had a nice time getting back into the flow of things and now feel ready to get back into the hustle and bustle of student life :)
